Then...

- show status for each table row (table rows have an
  associated status in Cucumber formatters, and the
  HTML formatter seems to take advantage of this. Why?
  And what consequences does this have on the way
  Scenario status is calculated in Cuukie?)
  
- find better way to manage Scenario/Step status (Cuukie
  calculates the status of Scenarios with a few ugly
  ifs and other dirty tricks. Maybe that information
  is already known to the formatter, and it's
  just a matter of using the right formatter events?)
  
- check rbx bug (interestingly, Rubynius has a different
  idea of where a "step" is. it seems to return different
  lines for steps than other rubies. I removed the line
  numbers from tests b/c of this, and b/c they made the
  tests fragile. Try to put back the line numbers,
  and test under rbx)
