MMF 0.2.3
  - you can use other formatters with cuukie
  - better error messages
  - work on any cucumber project out of the box (no need to add require())
MMF 0.2.4
  - don't launch server if it's already up
  - give detailed instructions if the port is unavailable 
MMF 0.2.5
  - deal with Scenario Examples
MMF 0.2.6
  - show incomplete wrap-up for steps/scenarios
MMF 0.2.7
  - open/close steps
MMF 1.0.0
  - nice graphics
  - self-updating Steps
  - self-updating Scenarios
  - self-updating suite
  - self-updating scenario wrap-up
  - self-updating step wrap-up
  - self-updating running time

Then...

- show tags

- filter by tag

- show original Cucumber command line

- don't get confused in case of multiple --format arguments

- default policy for open/close elements (like: close
  successfull scenarios/steps, open unsuccessful ones)
  
- instead of showing scenarios that appear one by one,
  show the entire suite ASAP, and then proceed to make
  each scenario red or green (or whatever). this
  gives an immediate feeling of where you are in the
  suite.

- show status for each table row (table rows have an
  associated status in Cucumber formatters, and the
  HTML formatter seems to take advantage of this. Why?
  And what consequences does this have on the way
  Scenario status is calculated in Cuukie?)
  
- find better way to manage Scenario/Step status (Cuukie
  calculates the status of Scenarios with a few ugly
  ifs and other dirty tricks. Maybe that information
  is already known to the formatter, and it's
  just a matter of using the right formatter events?)
  
- check rbx bug (interestingly, Rubynius has a different
  idea of where a "step" is. it seems to return different
  lines for steps than other rubies. I removed the line
  numbers from tests b/c of this, and b/c they made the
  tests fragile. Try to put back the line numbers,
  and test under rbx)

- windows compatibility
  
- test against rbx
